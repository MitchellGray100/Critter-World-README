Multiple Critters and rocks are in this world. The size of the critter and food illustrates its strength and energy respectively.
The direction (indicated by its eyes) that the critter is facing is the way it can move forward.
The selected critter glows white and has a blue glowing border.

Time is stepped and another food is spawned randomly in the world.
