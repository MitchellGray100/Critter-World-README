# Images of Game

The critter was clicked so the information related to the critter appears on the left hand side.

Multiple Critters and rocks are in this world. The size of the critter and food illustrates its strength and energy respectively.
The direction (indicated by its eyes) that the critter is facing is the way it can move forward.
The selected critter glows white and has a blue glowing border.

The Critter Info tab can increase or decrease in size to show more or less information for critters with large or small program trees.
